"Wristwear Dominates the Wearables Market While Clothing and Earwear Have Market-Beating Growth by 2021 The overall wearables market is expected to return to strong growth after a brief slowdown in 2016 that resulted from delayed launches of major platforms and notable vendors struggling to maintain pace.Looking ahead, new vendors, emerging form factors, and an expanded number of retail outlets will drive worldwide wearable device shipments from 102.4 million in 2016 to 237.5 million in 2021, a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.3%, according to new data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker.""With the shift towards watches and clothing, the need of a fashionable design will take center stage,"" said Jitesh Ubrani senior research analyst for IDC Mobile Device Trackers. ""Tech companies will be forced to step up their game and offer a wider selection of sizes, materials, and designs in order to appeal to a broader audience. We also expect more tech vendors to partner with fashion brands for their creativity, and equally important, their distribution network. In doing so, wearables will be made available to a previously unaware auidence – one that frequents fashion outlets over tech outlets.""Earworn devices are also poised for growth as new startups bring their innovative technology to the table and traditional headphone companies incorporate additional capabilities beyond audio. Though growth is expected, volumes will remain somewhat modest as the primary features of health and fitness tracking ""hearables"" overlap with the more popular wrist worn devices.In addition to the growth opportunity for these products, it is important to note the diversity of options within each category. ""Watches struggled as mass market devices due to limited and unclear value proposition to a broad base of potential users,"" noted Ramon T. Llamas, research manager for IDC's Wearables team. ""Most potential customers saw watches performing multiple functions, but none of them worked exceptionally well to accomplish a myriad of tasks. Going forward, we instead expect watches to hyper-segment into specific niches, including connected kids' watches, athletic watches, luxury and fashion watches, and lifestyle watches that better address different segment needs, whether they be communication, health and fitness, or as smart luxury and fashion timepieces. Not all of them will have the same features, but they will have enough – and the rights ones – to do the job.""The same approach can be applied to emerging products. Llamas added, ""Clothing, for example, can be designed to track athletic performance or to track vital information and communicate with workers – like first responders heading into dangerous situations. Similarly, companies are augmenting earwear with fitness tracking and smart coaching, while others are focusing on enhancing audio or providing real-time language translation. In both cases, the wearable is not taking a one-size fits all approach, and instead concentrates on specific solutions for specific use cases."" ""Em-Sense Enabled Smartwatch Can Detect When You Touch a DoorknobThe great promise of the smartwatch and its intelligent brethren is that they will unite everyday objects in a seamless web of connectivity. But there is a glaring hole in this plan: Our lives remain filled with countless dumb objects—door handles, lamps, pots and pans—that have no way of communicating with our smart objects. One solution is to make everything intelligent. A more discerning approach is to design objects that are clever enough to glean information from the dumb objects around them.This is the idea behind Em-Sense, a technology Carnegie Mellon’s future interfaces group developed with Disney Research. Outfitting a modified smartwatch with EM-Sense created a device that could differentiate between objects the wearer touched.It sounds like magic, but the technology is straightforward. Most electromechanical objects—electric toothbrushes, your laptop’s trackpad, power tools—emit electromagnetic signals when used. Things like ladders and door handles, which aren’t electric but are conductive also can emit an electromagnetic signature by receiving the EM radiation present in the surrounding environment. The human body is similarly conductive; touch an object that emits electromagnetic noise and that object’s signal courses through your body. Now here’s the crucial bit: Different objects emit slightly different levels of electromagnetic noise. The team embedded its smartwatch prototype with a modified radio chip that can sense these low-band electromagnetic signals. When strapped to your wrist, the watch uses a conducting electrode to sense the signal passing through your body. That signal is sent to a radio chip, and converted into digital data. By matching incoming signals to a library of electromagnetic signatures, the watch can identify what you’re touching, in real time.Gierad Laput, a lead researcher on the project, says this could lead to a new wave of context-based applications that are more accurate and nuanced than those using RFID or GPS. “A lot of context based apps are estimating what the user is doing but not knowing exactly what the user is doing,” he says. Though our devices already know plenty about us—our location, time of day, what’s on our calendar—there’s still an element of guesswork any time an app makes a decision on our behalf. Unlike RFID or GPS, which help our devices infer user activity by approximating their location, EmSense can detect what a person is interacting with at any given time. An app that relies on RFID might know you’re in your kitchen, but an app that relies on EmSense could determine what you’re doing there and act on it. That could be something as simple as a meeting reminder popping up when you touch the door to your office. Perhaps you open your fridge at 7 am, then pick up a pan and turn on the stove. Your smartwatch could reasonably infer that you’re making breakfast and perhaps you’d like to listen to Morning Edition while you cook your eggs.Laput cites other examples, like unlocking a laptop with a single touch or using the technology to differentiate between two people using the same touchscreen. Ultimately, this technology could be cheaply implemented into smartwatches. Then it would only be a matter of building the library of electromagnetic signatures, Laput says. This is important because right now, he says, there’s just not enough data available for these devices to be truly smart. Something like EmSense, then, could provide a bridge between the connected and unconnected world and add an additional layer of information that developers can draw on someday. “It just makes the data even smarter,” says Laput.""Wearable Market in India Saw Shipment of 2.5 Million Units in 2016Wearable market in India observed a shipment of 2.5 million units in 2016 with Goqii and Xiaomi dominating the entry-level segment, International Data Corporation's (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker has said.Total wearable shipments in the fourth quarter of 2016 were 675,000 units, which included both smart wearables that can run third party apps and basic wearables, which cannot.Wearables shipments declined 19.6 per cent sequentially as basic wearables -- that account to 86.4 per cent of total wearable -- declined 23.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016.""Shipments declined in the last quarter of the year after a sharp spike in third quarter owing to channel preparation for festive season in October,"" Navkendar Singh, Senior Research Manager at IDC India, said in a statement.""However, smart wearable shipments grew 23.6 per cent in CY Q4 2016 as new vendors like Fossil's made their entry into Indian wearable market and fresh shipments of new models from vendors like Apple and Samsung fuelled the growth"", Singh added.In terms of price, ""less than $50"" segment dominated the category accounting for 73 per cent of total wearable shipments. This segment was dominated by fitness trackers from vendors like Goqii and Xiaomi while Intex shipments shrank.""Owing to its low-cost affordability, this price segment continues to see mostly first time buyers experimenting this relatively new form factor in the market. In the effort to enhance value proposition, devices in this price segment has seen drastic evolution over last year from being basic activity trackers to one with display, basic phone notifications and heart rate sensors,"" Karthik J, Senior Market Analyst, Client Devices at IDC India, added.According to IDC India, the traction that wearable devices market saw in 2016 would continue in 2017.""Athletes Turn to Implants to Take Training Into the FutureWith the rollout this season of RFID (radio-frequency identification) player-tracking technology in every NFL stadium—bottle-cap-sized chips are embedded in every set of shoulder pads—the league can keep tabs on all of its players the same way that businesses do their inventories. The system, provided by Zebra Technologies and still largely kept under wraps by the NFL, is geared partly toward improving the TV experience, but when that data is opened up to fans and teams, things could get really interesting. We could soon see the routes every player runs, answering the question, Which Patriots receiver best matches up with Tom Brady? Strength and conditioning coaches could slice and dice data to extract whatever performance metrics they most care about—How far does Adrian Peterson actually run in each game?—and use that information to fine-tune training methods.Zebra’s system, though, is really only data lite. This setup tracks a player’s pads, not the human wearing them. To truly understand what each athlete goes through requires far more detailed telemetry. As a hint of where that is headed, consider: Zebra’s tags can also be used as communication hubs to relay info from any Bluetooth devices that a player might be wearing.The next big question: How far are players and coaches willing to go to gain an edge? Forget fitness wearables like Apple Watches and Fitbits—pushing limits on the field will require pushing far more personal limits. As director of Elite Performance for STATS LLC, Paul Robbins explores the world of wearables, patches and sensors on behalf of pro teams, and to show the future of the field, he carries around a half-inch by one-eighth-of-an-inch medical implant used for tracking heart rhythms. “When guys complain about a patch,” Robbins says, “I pull out the implant and say, ‘We could just imbed this into your chest.’ ”This seemingly distant future is much closer to the present in the world of endurance sports, where athletes are already using a host of medical technologies, from Band-Aid sized patches that were initially designed for tracking patient vital signs to continuous blood glucose monitors intended for diabetics. The problem with these types of sensors is the sheer volume of data they generate and how to best use that info. “We’re still moving out of a crude era,” says Sky Christopherson, a former Olympic track cyclist who embraced the power of big data when he trained the U.S.’s silver-medal-winning women’s team pursuit squad for London 2012. “It’s going to take some time until you really can individualize [training] to get each person to their potential.”Perhaps the most interesting—certainly the most personal—physiological data will come from DNA. An athlete’s genetic code may be the real key to reaching his or her full potential. Genes control how our bodies work, and variations on those genes are responsible for physical differences. Beyond hair and eye color, gene variants affect how our bodies create collagen, the main structural protein from which ligaments are made, and how we respond to supplements. Knowing an athlete’s genetic makeup could guide dietitians in designing nutrition programs, or it could predict whether an athlete is at greater risk of, say, an ACL tear, allowing coaches to tweak training around that fragility. “If we know where you’re weak,” says Jeremy Koenig, CEO of Athletigen, which uses DNA analysis to improve performance, “we can make you strong.” As DNA testing of athletes becomes more widespread, the line between personal medical data and a player’s personnel file will blur. We’ve already seen the issues this can cause: In 2005, after Eddy Curry missed 13 games with an irregular heartbeat, the Bulls asked their center to take a DNA test; he declined and was traded. “Pro athletes are people, and they should be respected as such; their info is private,” says Koenig. “But some would argue otherwise, that they’re a human asset.” The ’08 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act made it illegal to take action against an employee based on DNA testing, but that legislation ignores the fact that once something is known, it’s nearly impossible to ignore.The truly dark side of DNA analysis, though, might be in CRISPR/cas9, an existing technology that allows scientists to physically edit genetic code. Taken to its unethical extreme, CRISPR could render all of these ideas about nurturing imperfection redundant. Why would anyone ever dream of tweaking Brady or Peterson when you could just splice the two together?""Fitbit's Dominance Diminishes But Wearable Tech Market Bigger Than EverFitbit has taken a hit with year-on-year Q4 sales but the wearable tech market is bigger than ever.They are the two main takeways from the latest IDC Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker, which states that Fitbit shipments were down 22.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016: 6.5 million units compared to 8.4 million units in the same period in 2015.Overall, the amount of wearable tech devices shipped increased from 29 million units in 2015 to 33.9 million in 2016 – a year-on-year growth of 16.9 percentXiaomi was the fastest grower – up 96.2 percent from 2.6 million to 5.2 million, thanks partly to its growing exposure in the western world but mainly because of Chinese shipments for its newest trackers such as the Mi Band Pulse. Apple saw a steady increase of 13 percent, from 4.1 million to 4.6 million, following the launch of the Apple Watch Series 2.Garmin’s shipments dropped by 4 percent. However, the report states that the GPS giant raised its average selling price (ASP) to $258 from under $200 the previous year.""Like any technology market, the wearables market is changing,"" said Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC's Wearables team. ""Basic wearables started out as single-purpose devices tracking footsteps and are morphing into multi-purpose wearable devices, fusing together multiple health and fitness capabilities and smartphone notifications. It's enough to blur the lines against most smart wearables, to the point where first generation smartwatches are no better than most fitness trackers.""Meanwhile, smart wearables are also evolving,"" he continued. ""Health and fitness remains a major focus, but once these devices become connected to a cellular network, expect unique applications and communications capabilities to become available. This will also solve another key issue: freeing the device from the smartphone, creating a standalone experience.""Fitbit has already addressed its disappointing quarter, of course. Following the publication of its Q4 2016 financial results James Park, Fitbit CEO said:""We believe the evolving wearables market continues to present growth opportunities for us that we will capitalize on by investing in our core product offerings, while expanding into the smartwatch category to diversify revenue and capture share of the over $10 billion global smartwatch market. We believe we are uniquely positioned to succeed in delivering what consumers are looking for in a smartwatch: stylish, well-designed devices that combine the right general purpose functionality with a focus on health and fitness.""So we know that a Fitbit smartwatch is in the works and the company’s next tracker, the Fitbit Alta HR, also recently broke cover.However, IDC predicts that a new genre of hybrid devices – away from traditional smartwatches and fitness trackers – will begin to dominate in the years ahead.""As the technology disappears into the background, hybrid watches and other fashion accessories with fitness tracking are starting to gain traction,” explained said Jitesh Ubrani senior research analyst.“This presents an opportunity to sell multiple wearables to a single consumer under the guise of 'fashion.' But more importantly, it helps build an ecosystem and helps vendors provide consumers with actionable insights thanks to the large amounts of data collected behind the scenes.""""Electronic Skin May Transform the Way We Interact With TechIt’s still just a proof-of-concept, but ideas for how to use skins like this one come pretty easily—think the Bionic Man, or Luke Skywalker’s prosthetic hand. But only recently has microfabrication tech caught up to humanity’s cyborg dreams. Now, every few months or so, a lab comes out with a new, different design: A bunch of sensors stuck to a glove! Circuitry printed on weird sticky paper! “We’re at a very nascent stage,” says Benjamin Tee, an e-skin researcher at the Institute of Materials Research and Engineering in Singapore. “It’s basically a Wild West for electronic skin right now.” Scientists are still throwing ideas out to see what sticks. And here, “sticking” means the tech’s ability to be cheaply mass-produced with decent specs.In the short term, electronic skin probably won’t be anything’s actual skin. It’s promising for medicine, says Heon-Sang Lee, a chemical engineer at Dong-A University and an author of the paper. The skin is sensitive enough to detect sound waves, which would make it useful in hearing aids. And his team has strapped their bendy, Scotch tape-thin skin around wrists to measure pulse. “You get a much better signal from skin-like materials than you do from boxy and rigid wearables,” says John Rogers, a materials scientist at the University of Illinois. Rogers’ lab is working on temporary tattoo-like electronics to collect health data. Further in the future, e-skins could make for more sensitive surgical robots, or maybe wrap around exoskeletons to help the elderly get around.Beyond medicine, electronic skin is basically just a smart surface, so theoretically designers could slap it wherever humans interact with technology. Tee points to Apple’s recent investments in things like Force Touch and 3D Touch. “We’re definitely moving to seamless integration with the digital world,” he says. “The question is, how do we integrate with the digital world, which is essentially 1s and 0s, into something we can feel and interact with?” We’re all sensitive people—maybe our tech should be sensitive, too."
