# SuperCell
Hello, and welcome to indico's repo for public tutorials and the code that accompanies technical articles.

#### First get an indico API key
Many of these tutorials use indico API's, so you'll need to get a (free) API key. Go to [indico.io](https://indico.io) to register (or to generate a new key if you've already registered and forgotten our old key).

## Plotlines
An exploration of the "shapes of stories" using sentiment analysis API and a few hacks. Presented as an experiment using a jupyter/ipython notebook.


## Semi-supervised transfer learning with custom models
Comparison of four different machine learning strategies:
   1. Build a model from scratch using scikit-learn.
   2. Integrate a pre-built API.
   3. Build a custom model on top of word-level features.
   4. Transfer features from a pre-built model into a custom classifier.
